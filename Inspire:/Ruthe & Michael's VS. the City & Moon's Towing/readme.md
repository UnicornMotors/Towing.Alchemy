My husband got a 26' box truck hung up on a concrete filled steel bollard.
We called Tony the Tow Man and he absolutely, positively came through for us. He managed to lift the back end of the truck up off of the bollard and boomed it …More

Absolutely HORRENDOUS service and will go out of their way to scam as much money out of you as possible. The man at the front window would not even let me get out what I needed before telling me it could not be done. I was hung up on multiple times, spoken to in such a condescending and disgusting manner, and put on hold solely to run out the clock until I could be charged for another day. The only useful information was given to me by the customer in line behind me. Find any other towing company if possible. This place needs to be shut down

Tony the Tow Man just came out in his Freightliner and rescued my 75,000 lb oil processing rig from some crazy soft gravel in a substation. It was a sight to see! Thanks Tony!

I normally don't post reviews but this company deserves what I'm about to say.

Horrible and corrupt company. Reported my car stolen in December in Orleans Parish and was found in March. Jefferson Police called me and said that my car was gonna be towed to this company's lot.

If I had known how greedy and unreasonable they would be, I would've told them just to leave my car where they found it.

Not only when I tell them that my car was reported stolen months ago do they not waive the impound or towing fee, they tell me that each day it sits in the lot, it racks of more fees of $100 a day. So now, not only are they holding my property hostage and I'm being robbed twice, the staff is rude and unprofessional and are of no help at all.

If you have the choice, never use their service. They charge exorbitant amounts just for you retrieve your property even if you're car was stolen at no fault of your own

If I could give them a ZERO, I would. RUN, RUN, RUN!!! The only reason they are open is because the Government has a contract with them because they accept lowest bids and they were the Lowest Bidders.  Insurance companies do NOT want to deal with this place. This is who the Police will call for Towing Service. Do NOT use them people. These NEGATIVE reviews are TRUE!!!

I don't know where to begin... After the guy came over and put my car on the flatbed to tow my car, he told me that he will charge me $213 for just moving my car from the middle of the road to curbside. I feel like I was basically embezzled. Furthermore he was constantly yelling for no reason, overall nightmare like experience. Please do yourself a favor and do not use this company for anything!
